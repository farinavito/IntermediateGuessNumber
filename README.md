# IntermediateGuessNumber
A slightly more advanced game - Guess the number

OVERVIEW:

The player must guess a number between 1 and 100, which is created randomly by computer. Player will get some help from the programme, 
saying to him/her to guess lower or higher. When he types in the correct number (the number created randomly by computer), the programme  
will congratulated him/her. It will also writte out how many attempts he/she needed to guess the correct number. Player's attempts will 
be stored in a score.txt file. This programme will print out only top 3 scores. 

WARNING:

This game is not suitable for production. When you will start the programme, you will get an FileNotFoundError, saying no such file.
If you want to play this game, you have to comment out (using #) the code from the beginning to import random (not included).
After you have played your first game, you can erase the # tags, but not the code! Now you will have the original code and the score.txt,
where your results will be stored.
